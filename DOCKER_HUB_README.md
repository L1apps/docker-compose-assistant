# Docker Compose Assistant (DCA)

**A smart, web-based editor and analyzer for Docker Compose files.**

The Docker Compose Assistant is a privacy-first web application designed to help you write, validate, and fix `docker-compose.yml` files. It runs entirely in your browser (client-side) and connects to AI providers (Google Gemini or Local LLMs) to provide intelligent suggestions, auto-formatting, and explanations.

## 🚀 Quick Start

The easiest way to run the assistant is using Docker Compose. You can pull from Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry.

    services:
      dca-app:
        # Docker Hub
        image: l1apps/docker-compose-assistant:latest
        
        # GitHub Container Registry
        # image: ghcr.io/l1apps/docker-compose-assistant:latest
        
        container_name: docker-compose-assistant
        ports:
          - "8500:80" 
        restart: unless-stopped

Or run it directly with the Docker CLI:

    # Docker Hub
    docker run -d -p 8500:80 --name docker-compose-assistant l1apps/docker-compose-assistant:latest

    # GitHub Container Registry
    docker run -d -p 8500:80 --name docker-compose-assistant ghcr.io/l1apps/docker-compose-assistant:latest

Once running, access the editor at: **http://localhost:8500**

## ✨ Features
